Welcome to the documentation of the Ghost OS!

This project is a research operating system for the Intel x86 platform with
almost all components written from scratch. The kernel follows a microkernel
design. This documentation section contains both conceptual and technical
documentation for various parts of the system.

NOTE: This file is supposed to be compiled with AsciiDoctor
(http://asciidoctor.org/), see the script `generate.sh`.

The contents of this documentation are split in sections for each system
component. On the top of each page there's a link back to this home page.
