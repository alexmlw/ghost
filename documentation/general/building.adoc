Getting started
---------------
This document contains an explanation on how to build entire operating system from source.

The project consists of two repositories:

* *ghost*, main repository containing the source code for the system
* *ghost-sysroot*, a blueprint for the system root directory

The system root directory (sysroot) is a concept used in cross compiling. It contains
the initial filesystem that is used to boot the OS. All cross-compiled libraries and
applications are installed in this folder, and when cross-compiling a program or
library, the compiler uses this directory as the location to search for headers,
libraries and more. This avoids using the host systems header files.


Checking out
------------

. Clone the ghost-sysroot to `/ghost/sysroot` (If you want to use a different folder, see the "Tips" section below).
. Clone the main repository somewhere to your filesystem (for example `/ghost/source`)


Installing prerequisites
------------------------
There are some pre-requisites that you need to install on your host system. On Linux you
should be able to easily install them with `apt`;

* `apt install libmpfr-dev libgmp-dev libmpc-dev`
* `apt install autoconf2.64 pkg-config grub2`
* `apt install texinfo flex bison xorriso`
* `apt install gcc g++ nasm`
* `apt install asciidoc asciidoctor`

You may need to `export AUTOCONF=autoconf2.64` depending on your installation.

On Cygwin
~~~~~~~~~
Install the required packages that are described below via the Cygwin setup, except:

* autoconf2.64 must be built from source
* xorriso must be built from source, install libiconv-devel in Cygwin setup beforehand.
	(It wants to be built & configured in the source directory)
* grub2 must be built from source. Use grub-1.99 and do `export TARGET_CFLAGS="-Wno-error"`
	`export CFLAGS="-Wno-error"` before configure

On Mac OS
~~~~~~~~~
If you are on Mac OS X, you must make sure that the GNU GCC is used (default alias points to LLVM).
Use export to set the correct version:

-----
export CC=gcc-5
export CXX=g++-5
export CPP=cpp-5
export LD=gcc-5
-----


Building the toolchain
----------------------
Run the toolchain setup script `toolchain.sh`. It will attempt to do everything that is
necessary to create the toolchain.

If the process fails on one step, open the respective build folder (for example `temp/build-gcc`)
and check for a `ghost-build.log` file.

Once the toolchain was built, you might want to add it to your PATH.


Building the system
-------------------
There is a `build.sh` in the main folder that installs required libraries, builds all
applications and then builds and packs the kernel.

For building manually, the essential order is:

* `./libapi/build.sh`
* `./libc/build.sh`
* `./libuser/build.sh`
* `./applications/*/build.sh`
* `./kernel/build.sh`

The generated ISO image can then be found in `kernel/bin/image.iso`.


Library dependency
------------------
libapi is the lowest layer library that provides wrapping of system calls. On top of this
is the libc that utilizes libapi. libuser builds on top of these and provides high-level
functionalities.

Third-party software
--------------------
To install third-party libraries, it is usually necessary to provide some parameters to the
`./configure` script:

* `--host=i686-ghost` to set the correct host
* `--prefix=/system` to install libraries to the correct folder

There is also a simplified port installation script in `patches/ports` that allows automatically
downloads, patches and installs some third-party libraries.

Tips
----
* To specify a different toolchain base directory, modify `TOOLCHAIN_BASE`, copy the
	`variables.sh.template` to `variables.sh` and specify the variable with an export.
* While binutils and gcc are being built, the log output is redirected to a file named
	`ghost-build.log` in the respective build directory in the temporary folder. If the
	build fails for some reason, you should check this log file.
